				<li><em>Moby Dick: Revenge of the Space-Whale</em></li>
				<li id="last">As an established piece of literature, Moby Dick has become a part of the contemporary literary zeitgeist and a fairy tale in its own right. Certain key aspects of the setting and character dynamic have been “fractured” in Astronomy Club's booth. The story is set in a futuristic steam-punk space-world, where humans traverse the cosmos in the pursuit of space-whales to obtain valuable space-whale blubber and its byproducts. Captain Ahab, a space-whaler, has long engaged in a vengeful pursuit of the great white space-whale who destroyed Space-Colony α-17 and its complement of humans and squids — including his own family. For the past forty space-years, Captain Ahab has relentlessly, singlemindedly and monomaniacally pursued the elusive Moby Dick, lord of the space-whales, and a key architect of the destruction of α-17. Visitors can help free Captain Ahab from his self-imposed prison of vengeful thoughts by throwing beanbag-harpoons at Moby Dick, thus allowing Ahab to finally achieve release.</li>
